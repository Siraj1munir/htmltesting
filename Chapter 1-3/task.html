    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>Today I was so happy because I have got admission in <em>University</em>. The field I have chosen was <strong> Computer Science </strong> and in future I will be so called as <strong> Computer Scientist </strong>. Before this i was working with my friend on <em>Arduino Microcontroller</em> and I was wondering to be an Electronic Engineer. Technology is so funny it changes day to day without any limit and still their is alot to be explore.</p>
